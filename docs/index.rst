A printer driver is a specialized software application that enables your computer’s operating system to communicate with the printer hardware. When you send a document to print, the driver translates this data into precise commands, instructing the printer on resolution, color depth, page layout, duplex settings and media handling.

Canon Laser Printer Driver Setup Guide
======================================

Why Selecting the Correct Driver Matters
----------------------------------------

Installing the exact driver for your Canon laser printer ensures:

- Optimal performance
- Compatibility with your operating system
